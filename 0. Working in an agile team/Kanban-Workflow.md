**How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?**

Kanban helps me manage priorities by visualizing tasks on a board, making it easy to see what’s in progress, what’s pending and what’s completed. It prevents overload through Work In Progress limits, ensuring team members focus on finishing tasks before starting new ones.

**How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?**

I can improve my workflow by breaking tasks into smaller steps, limiting how many I work on at once and regularly reviewing the board to adjust priorities. This keeps my work organized, focused and easier to manage.
