**What was your first impression of the app?**

The app has a clean and welcoming interface. The design feels calming, which aligns well with the intention to help users stay focused. However, it may need more UI improvements to make it engaging

**Did you find anything difficult to understand?**

During onboarding, I found several areas that could be improved. Cross-device sync wasnâ€™t clearly explained and timer settings lacked intuitive options like presets. Creating a routine felt confusing, especially around timing and step structure. Lastly, multiple permission requests came too quickly without clear explanations.

**If you had to explain Focus Bear to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?**

If you need an app to block distractions, Focus Bear is a productivity tool that helps you develop better habits and maintain focus by guiding you through structured routines.

**What are some changes that could improve the new user experience?**

To improve onboarding, Focus Bear could add a short interactive tutorial and group features into clear stages. Preset routines would help users get started quickly, while friendly tooltips can clarify permissions.
