**What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?**

Focus Bear stands out by specifically catering to neurodivergent users, especially those with ADHD and ASD. Unlike general productivity tools like Freedom or Cold Turkey, which focus mainly on blocking distractions. It emphasizes creating sustainable routines with mental wellness in mind, rather than just enforcing productivity.

**If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?**

I would choose Focus Bear because it offers a more holistic and supportive approach. Instead of just blocking distractions, it guides me through routines and helps me build better habits. Its friendly, inclusive design and focus on mental health make it feel like a personal coach rather than just a productivity tool.

**What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?**

Tiimo offers a highly visual, calendar style timeline that’s particularly helpful for visual thinkers. This level of schedule visualization isn’t currently a core part of Focus Bear and adding something similar could enhance its usability.

**Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?**

Focus Bear could improve by introducing more customization for routine visuals. These features, common in apps like Tiimo and Routinery, can make the user experience more intuitive and accessible, especially for those who process information better visually.
