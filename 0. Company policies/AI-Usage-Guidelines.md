**When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?**  

I turn to AI only after I’ve made a solid attempt on my own. I believe it’s important to first apply my own knowledge and problem-solving skills before seeking assistance from AI tools.

**How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?**  

To avoid becoming too dependent on AI, I make sure I fully understand the problem and the solution suggested by the AI. Once I grasp the concept, I prefer to write the code myself instead of copying it directly.

**What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?**  

I’ll avoid pasting full codebases or sensitive data into AI tools. If I need to reference specific examples, I will anonymize any confidential information or rename key variables and data before sharing.
