**What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup?**

I can use an external monitor at eye level, a laptop stand and an adjustable chair to create a more ergonomic setup.

**What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?**

I’ll focus on sitting upright, keeping my feet flat on the floor, adjusting screen height to avoid neck strain and taking regular stretch breaks.

**How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day?**

I’ll use Focus Bear to schedule movement and posture check reminders to stay consistent with breaks.
