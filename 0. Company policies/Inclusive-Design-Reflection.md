**How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?**

I can adjust my communication style by being clear, direct, and structured. Avoiding vague language and giving people time to process or respond can help create a more inclusive environment.

**What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?**

Overloading users with too many choices or steps during onboarding, using abstract or unclear language, and lacking visual structure can make the experience overwhelming, especially for neurodivergent users. Inconsistent layouts, fast-paced animations, or a lack of customization options can also hinder accessibility.

**What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?**

One change I can make is to always review my designs or content with accessibility in mind. This means ensuring clear labels, consistent navigation, and offering multiple ways to interact with content.
