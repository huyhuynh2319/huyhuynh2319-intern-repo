**What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?**

I currently use strong, unique passwords for each of my accounts and have two-factor authentication enabled for most services. I keep my devices updated and avoid using public Wi-Fi without a VPN. However, I could improve by consistently using a password manager instead of relying on browser-stored passwords.

**How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?**

By building security into my daily workflow like locking my screen whenever I step away and doing regular security check-ins, I can make secure behavior part of my routine. Setting reminders or using tools that automate security also helps reinforce good habits.

**What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?**

I’ll move all my passwords into a secure password manager and audit them to ensure they’re strong and unique. I’ll also enable 2FA on all my work-related accounts and avoid reusing passwords across platforms.

**What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?**

I would immediately change my password, log out of all devices, and report the incident to the security or IT team. I’d also check if any other accounts were compromised and monitor for unusual activity.
